# *utilmaths* 

A short, header based, library of maths types and functions for scientific computing in `C++`. 

This is being written for my own personal interest and use in projects such as path-tracers. 

Tested with [`gtest`](https://github.com/google/googletest).

#### Features:
- templated complex numbers with:
	- operator overloads
	- complex conjugate
	- modulus
	- complex exponentials
	- realness test
- complex numbers as arguments of vectors and matrix types

#### TODO:
- vectors
- matrices
